# QuantumSafe Chain: Post-Quantum Secure Blockchain Network

## 📌 Project Description
QuantumSafe Chain is a prototype blockchain smart contract designed to simulate **post-quantum secure** principles.  
It focuses on secure transaction storage and ownership management, with a vision to evolve into a quantum-resistant blockchain framework.  

This project is implemented in Solidity and demonstrates how blockchain systems can be adapted to withstand **future quantum computing threats**.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
To build a **quantum-resilient blockchain network** that ensures secure transactions, data protection, and robust consensus mechanisms even in a world where **quantum computers** can break traditional cryptography.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Quantum-Safe Transactions**: Simulates encrypted transactions that can be adapted for post-quantum cryptographic schemes.  
- **Ownership Control**: Allows secure transfer of contract ownership.  
- **Immutable Record-Keeping**: All transactions are stored permanently on the blockchain.  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration of **real post-quantum cryptographic algorithms** (e.g., lattice-based, hash-based signatures).  
- Development of a **consensus mechanism resilient to quantum attacks**.  
- Expansion into a **full blockchain framework** supporting smart contracts and dApps.  
- Cross-chain compatibility with existing EVM-based blockchains.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Solidity `^0.8.20`
- Ethereum / EVM Compatible Network
- Hardhat / Truffle (optional for deployment & testing)
